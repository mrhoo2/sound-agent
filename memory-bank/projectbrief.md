# Project Brief: Sound Agent

## Overview
<!-- What is this project? Provide a high-level description in 1-2 sentences -->
This project is a tool that analyzes HVAC sound data. It should take common metrics like dBA, db octave bands, sones, and NC ratings, and perform conversions or confirm compliance between design requirements and submission data.
## Core Requirements
<!-- What must this project do? List the essential features/capabilities -->
- Convert between common HVAC sound criteria (e.g., sones, NC, db bands, dBA)
- Confirm compliance between listed design requirements and submitted performance data.
- Handle multiple file types, including screenshots or PDFs.

## Goals
<!-- What are you trying to achieve? What does success look like? -->
- A design engineer should be able to describe their space and get helpful recommendations from reliable sources, including the ASHRAE Handbooks.
- A purchasing agent should be able to upload documents or a link to the documents. These documents could include 

## Scope
<!-- What's in scope and out of scope for this project? -->

### In Scope
- Find sound requirements listed in design documentation, including mechanical schedules and specifications.
- Convert between sones, dBA, db frequency bands, and NC ratings.

### Out of Scope
- 

## Timeline
<!-- Any key dates or milestones? -->

## Stakeholders
<!-- Who is involved in this project? Who is it for? -->
This project is geared primarily for three audiences; HVAC design engineers, HVAC equipment purchasers, and HVAC sales representatives. It should include workflows for each.
